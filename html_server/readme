Known issue:
warning from firefox:
"""SyntaxError: Using //@ to indicate source map URL pragmas is deprecated. Use //# instead jquery-2.0.3.min.js:1"""
casued by jquery 2.0.3, can be fixed by using jquery 2.1, but 2.1 is still in developmeng.


warning from firefox:
"""Unknown property 'box-sizing'.  Declaration dropped."""
caused by jquery, it seems like a firefox bug.
