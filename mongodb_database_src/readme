install mongodb and restore the backup file

download the mongoc C driver from https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-c-driver/zipball/v0.8.1
extract and run 'make' and 'sudo make install' finally 'make clean'

on Fedora run the following
su -c "echo /usr/local/lib > /etc/ld.so.conf.d/mongoc.conf"
su -c "ldconfig"

to use mongodb in a source file, include mongo.h
include flag -lmongoc with gcc
ie. gcc -o <output> -std=c99 -lmongoc <source>
